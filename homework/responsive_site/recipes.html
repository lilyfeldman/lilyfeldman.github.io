    <h3> Peanut Butter Acai Bowl </h3>
    <h5>Serves: 1 <br>

    Total Time: 15 minutes<br></h5>

This acai bowl recipe takes its name from Loco Moco, a popular, protein-dense Hawaiian breakfast dish that features white rice topped with hamburger patties, fried eggs and gravy. This cleaned-up breakfast packs plenty of protein with peanut butter along with vitamins and minerals from the almond milk and berries. You can also add a scoop of your favorite protein powder for an added protein spike!</p>
<h5> INGREDIENTS:<h5>
ACAI PURÉE

<ul>1/2 small banana</ul>
<ul>1 1/2 tsp natural unsalted peanut butter</ul>
<ul>1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</ul>
<ul>1 100-g (3.5-oz) pack frozen unsweetened acai berry pulp</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup frozen strawberries</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk (TIP: Instead of almond milk, you can substitute a mix of ¼ cup coconut milk combined with ¼ cup water.)</ul></li>

TOPPINGS
<ul>1/2 small banana, sliced</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup granola, optional</ul>
<ul>2 tsp shredded unsweetened coconut</ul>
<ul>1 tbsp cocoa nibs</ul>
<ul>1 1/2 tsp natural unsalted peanut butter</ul>
<ul>Drizzle of raw honey, optional</ul>
<p>To a blender, add banana, peanut butter, cocoa powder, acai pulp, strawberries and a splash of milk. (TIP: Add to blender in that order as adding softer ingredients first makes it easier on your blender blades.) Blend on low until larger chunks are broken down, then gradually increase speed, adding a splash of milk at a time, and stopping to scrape down sides of blender if needed. When ingredients have mostly come together and all of milk has been added, blend on high for 15 to 20 seconds more.</p>

<br>
The easiest and most flavorful homemade Thai red curry you will ever make in just 30-40 minutes! It tastes just like the restaurant-version, except 10000x times better and cheaper!</p>
<h5> INGREDIENTS:<h5>

  <ul>1 1/2 cups basmati rice</ul>
<ul>1 tablespoon canola oil</ul>
<ul>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks</ul>
<ul>2 shallots, minced</ul>
<ul>3 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
<ul>3 tablespoons red curry paste</ul>
<ul>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</ul>
<ul>1 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk</ul>
<ul>1 bunch broccolini, cut into 3-inch pieces</ul>
<ul>2 green onions, thinly sliced</ul>
<ul>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</ul>
<p>In a large saucepan of 3 cups water, cook rice according to package instructions; set aside.
Heat canola oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. Add chicken, shallots and garlic to the stockpot and cook until golden, about 3-5 minutes.
Stir in red curry paste and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir in coconut milk. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced and thickened, about 10-15 minutes.
Stir in broccolini until just tender, about 3 minutes.
Remove from heat; stir in green onions, cilantro and lime juice; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Serve immediately with rice.</p>
