  <p> Hey! Welcome to Not Just Another Food Blog. We hope that if you made it to this page, you are a lover of food, travel and culture, you love to cook just as much as you do eating out, and most importantly (at least we think), you use food to bring yourself closer to others. Whether you are vegan or carnivore, we think this blog has it for you.</p>
